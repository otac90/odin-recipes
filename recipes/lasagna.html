      <li>Water (room temperature) - 360ml</li>
      <li>Salt (fine) - 14g</li>
      <li>Yeast (dried or fresh) - around 0.2g to 0.5g</li>
      <li>300g tin of plum tomatoes</li>
      <li>Tomato puree (optional) - a tablespoon</li>
      <li>Salt - sprinkling of table salt or sea salt</li>
      <li>Pepper - freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Mozzarella - 2 x 125g bags of fresh Mozzarella balls</li>
      <li>Parmesan - about 30g</li>
      <li>Olive Oil - a few glugs</li>
      <li>Basil - hand full of fresh leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix all the ingredients into a shaggy mass in a large bowl, starting by
        adding the water first. You can do this by hand or use a wooden spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with cling film, a plastic carrier bag, or a damp cloth
        (if the cloth isn't damp the dough may dry out).
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave the dough to rest for around 1 hour (the technical term for this
        process is the Autolyse).
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead for around 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Place the dough back into the bowl and cover</li>
      <li>
        Leave the dough to prove (in one big lump, don't worry about the shape)
        for around 20 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 4 equal parts (250g each) using some kitchen
        scales and a knife (or dough scraper) Do this about 4 hours before you
        intend to cook the pizza (after about a 20 hour prove).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place each dough ball into a small bowhl and cover. Alternatively, use a
        large tupperware container with a lid, or two smaller ones.
      </li>
      <li>Leave the dough balls to prove again for about 4-6 hours.</li>
    </ol>
